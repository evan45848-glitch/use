Sure — I’ll break it down **clearly and properly, step by step** 👇

Your command:

```powershell
irm https://dub.sh/nahid | iex
```

This has **three main parts**:

---

# 🔹 Part 1 — `irm`

`irm` = **Invoke-RestMethod**

Full form:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod
```

👉 What it does:

It **downloads (fetches) the content of a URL** and prints it as text in PowerShell.

So this part:

```powershell
irm https://dub.sh/nahid
```

means:

> “Go to this link and get whatever text/script is there.”

If you ran ONLY this:

```powershell
irm https://dub.sh/nahid
```

You would just see the script printed on your screen.

---

# 🔹 Part 2 — The Pipe `|`

The pipe (`|`) means:

> “Take the output from the left side and send it to the right side.”

So:

```powershell
irm https://dub.sh/nahid | iex
```

Means:

> Take whatever comes from the website and pass it to `iex`.

---

# 🔹 Part 3 — `iex`

`iex` = **Invoke-Expression**

Full form:

```powershell
Invoke-Expression
```

👉 What it does:

It **executes whatever text it receives as PowerShell code**.

So when you do:

```powershell
irm https://dub.sh/nahid | iex
```

You are basically saying:

> “Download a script from this URL and immediately run it.”

---

# ✅ Put together — Plain English meaning

This command means:

> Download the script from `https://dub.sh/nahid` and run it directly in PowerShell.

It is equivalent to:

1. Download script
2. Then manually run it

But both are done in **one line automatically**.

# ⚠️ Important Security Note (very important to understand)

This pattern:

```powershell
irm <url> | iex
```

is **very dangerous** if you don’t trust the URL.

Why?

Because:

* You are **blindly executing code from the internet**
* That code can:

  * Delete files
  * Steal data
  * Install malware
  * Take control of your system

💡 **Safer alternative (recommended when learning):**

First check what you are about to run:

```powershell
irm https://dub.sh/nahid
```

If the script looks safe, **then** run it manually.

---

# If you want, I can:

* Explain what **that specific script** does line-by-line
* Convert this same idea into **Linux (bash) explanation**
* Or show you a **safer version** of running remote scripts

Just tell me 👍
